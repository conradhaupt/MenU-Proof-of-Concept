-------------------
This is an app for Android 4.0+ that allows you to order food from a restaurant (mostly for cafeterias) and then collect your food (when notified)through a system of verification methods etc... It is built mainly for use by businesspeople and students who need to order food for later but need to work or they can't get to order as lines are too long.

Certain libraries are used in this project. The ones used are listed below:
